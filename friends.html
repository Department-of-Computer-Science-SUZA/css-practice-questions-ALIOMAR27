        <h2 >My best Friends</h2>
        <p> True friends always support each other even during the hardest of times.
            A true friend is one who feels happy for our success, on the other hand,
            who feel gloomy for our failures.
            A true friend may criticize also so that we may come out of our weakness.
            He may scold us if we do a mistake and guide the right path. 
            Thank you.
